# Manases Lopez SEI-Project 1-Checkers

## **Intro to checkers**

Game of checkers. The main goal of the game is to take all of the other players pieces, the players with no pieces left is declared to loose while it diplays a message saying which player has won which is either player 1 or player 2.

This is the start of the game (the main screen) it is a usual start of the game checkers and as usual player 1 is the one who is going to start the game, player one is represented as red and player 2 is represented as blue, the game does not and will not start until player one makes the first move and after that player two will be able to make the next move.

When going thru the game and you start capturing the pieces you will be able to see the pieces that had been captured by each of the players.

when a piece of either player has got to the other side it will be able to become a piece of the upper class and will be able to move backwards.

## Thechnologies used

For this project to work I used the HTML that diplays the game and then I used CSS to implement the good looking for the game and then the hardest part which is the JS file which it is the game itselft.

## Challenging code parts

The challenges I had was to get the king to work, it was hard to implement it and it was hard to change it's aparience but thanks to other people and people on discord I finally got it to work.

Another challenge I had was to get things from the doom but thanks to other people's project nick I got an idea to how to use the things I had to make my game work.

## Next steps

For the future I want to implement some explosions effect and sound effect to the game for each time you eat a piece or move them, for when you move a piece I would add just a sound effect but when a piece takes another piece I would add an explosions effect to make it look different plus I think that would be cool.

Another thing I would like to add would be an AI and a win counter to see how may time a player wins.
